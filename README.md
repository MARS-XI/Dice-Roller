# Dice Roller
D&D-like Dice Roller.  
Avaiable Dices: **D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D20, D100, DX**  
All dices accept *integer* modifiers.  
If a dice is rolled more than once the modifier is applied *after* all the rolls.   
If the modifier makes the result a negative number a 1 is displayed instead (1 being the lowest score possible of a real dice)   

## Input
The number of rolls is selectable with the arrow of a spinbox (up to 100 rolls)  
or by typing the number of rolls desidered (no limit to number of rolls)  

## Output
The result is the sum of the rolls of a single type of dice.  
Rolls of different dices are not summed.

**NOTE**:
